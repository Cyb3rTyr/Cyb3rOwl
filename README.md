- **System Health Check**: Evaluates the general health of your system and provides feedback.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.

## Setup

The `setup.py` script will automatically handle the installation of dependencies and setup for the project. This will make the process seamless and straightforward for the user.
