# 🔥 Ultimate Security Toolkit

The **Ultimate Security Toolkit** is a **powerful all-in-one security solution** designed for both **real-time system protection** and **offline recovery & forensics**. 

This project is divided into two main components:

- **[🛡️ The App (Main System)](#-the-app-main-system)**
  - A lightweight security tool for **daily protection, cleanup, and password management**.
- **[💾 The ISO (Bootable Environment)](#-the-iso-bootable-environment)**
  - A **standalone, bootable** security toolkit for **advanced malware removal, data recovery, OS repair, and forensic analysis**.

Both tools work **independently or together** to ensure **maximum security and system recovery capabilities**.
